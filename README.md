> ### Webpack configuration for React with Babel and Hot Module Reloading

Minimal React boilerplate with only five files: three configuration files, one html and one javascript file

*   webpack.config.js
*   package.json
*   .babelrc
*   index.html
*   app.js

This demystifies what is happening under the hood of a React application.

**Hot Module Reloading:** Quickly tweak UI without losing state
**Babel:** Use ES6 features and polyfills
